This site runs on Joomla, since, I think, the Joomla 1.x days. The Joomla team recently released Joomla 4 and they're getting ready to shut down support for Joomla 3. In preparation for this, I removed the site map menu and upgraded the SEO engine.

I haven't used attachments in this site in a long time, so I will soon delete the attachments plugin and update all articles that had attachments (10 articles). I'll put a notice on the top of each affected page and, if the attachment is still relevant, store it somewhere else and provide a link to the file's new location.
